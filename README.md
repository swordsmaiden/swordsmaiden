<p align="center">hi! you can call me emrys or swordie, maybe even delilah if you want. i&#39;m not opposed to new names.
	<br>i&#39;m brazilian, but fluent in english and knowledgeable in a bit of spanish.
	<br>
	<br>i&#39;m mostly found on the safe esp/pt-br server around my friends. though if you see me on any fandom areas, come say hi! or don&#39;t.
	<br>prone to being offtab at times. don&#39;t be afraid to send a whisper if you&#39;re unsure.
	<br>
	<br>that&#39;s all. thanks for reading!</p>
